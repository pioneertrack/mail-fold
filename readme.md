### Demo blog application powered by Rails, react, graphql and Relay.

This blog is an exploration exercise to understand two new technologies - GraphQL and Relay. We are using standard rails application together with webpack for handling front-end dependencies.

### Status
Application supports reading and creating data from and on server using GraphQL.
